# LinkedIn_Connections
Leverages the unofficial linkedin_api to find connections.

## Purpose
From a list of people given their names and company, this program will attempt to find each person on linkedin and generate a list of all availible connections from your LinkedIn account to their account. Highly recommended you read the docs https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api if you are seeking to use and or understand the functionality and limitations of this API.

## Usage

Put the path of the config file in the main function in the jupyter notebook. In the jupyter notebook, be sure the requirements have been downloaded, then execute the notebook. All progress will be logged.
